PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE FILE NAMED "Respiro1.0(Alpha).apk AS THE LATEST TEST BUILD.
Once downloaded use instruction on the screen to place the phone at an appropriate distance.
The values used can be calibrated for the three readings we can achieve. Manual calibration by comparing breathing effort with an off the shelf incentive respirometer and setting the appropriate values is the only way i know to calibrate it right now.

Please email me ben96.jc@gmail.com if you have any questions
